Privacy Policy for MyFavs
Effective date: December 20, 2025

Introduction
MyFavs ("we", "us", "the App") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, how long we keep it, and your rights. By using MyFavs you agree to the practices described here.

Data We Collect
- Contact information: email address (for authentication and account management).
- Metadata and Content: artist/album/track metadata (titles, preview URLs, ISRC, album/artist names) and any content you create (ratings, reviews).
- Usage and Diagnostics: analytics events, app usage, performance and crash logs (to improve the app).
- Preferences: UI and app preferences, local settings.
- Other: any information you explicitly provide (e.g., when contacting support).

How We Collect Data
- You provide data when you sign up, sign in, import or sync music metadata, rate tracks, or contact support.
- We collect usage and diagnostic data automatically when you use the App.
- We may fetch public metadata and preview content from third-party services (for example, Spotify, iTunes/Apple Music, or Deezer) to display album/track information and play previews. We do not collect or store personal account credentials from those services and do not collect personal user data from them unless you explicitly provide it to us.

Purposes for Data Use
We use data to:
- Provide and maintain the App, including authentication and syncing metadata.
- Personalize your experience (saved preferences, lists).
- Process and store ratings and content you provide.
- Improve and analyze the App (analytics, debugging).
- Communicate with you about account or support requests.
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.

Data Sharing and Third Parties
We may share data with:
- Service providers who operate and host our backend (e.g., Supabase or managed Postgres), cloud infrastructure providers, and other vendors we use to operate the App.
- Analytics and crash-reporting providers (if used) to analyze usage and fix issues.
- Legal authorities when required by law or to protect rights and safety.

Media metadata and preview content fetched from third-party APIs (Spotify, iTunes/Apple Music, Deezer) are retrieved directly from those providers for display and playback. We do not collect personal user data from those providers as part of that process. If metadata returned by a provider contains personal data (unlikely for public metadata), we will treat it according to this policy.

We do not sell personal data.

Data Retention
We retain personal data as long as necessary to provide the service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and for legitimate business purposes. You can request deletion of your account and associated personal data (see Your Rights).

Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data (encryption in transit, access controls). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Children
The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under applicable minimum ages. If you believe we have collected such data, contact us to request deletion.

Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:
- Access, correct, or delete your personal data.
- Object to or restrict processing.
- Port data in a machine-readable format.
To exercise these rights, contact us at the address below. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling requests.

International Transfers
Your data may be processed or stored outside your country. We use appropriate safeguards required by law for international transfers.

Apple-Specific Notes (for App Store Review)
- Data collected: account email, app usage analytics, ratings/reviews, and music metadata as described above.
- Purpose: app functionality (authentication, storing ratings), analytics and diagnostics, media metadata retrieval, and preview playback.
- Third-party SDKs/APIs: the App integrates with backend services and third-party content providers (e.g., Supabase for backend). The App may fetch public metadata and preview content from providers such as Spotify, iTunes/Apple Music, or Deezer; these requests retrieve public media metadata and preview URLs only — we do not collect or store users' Spotify/Deezer/Apple account credentials or personal data from those providers.
- Advertising: the App does not display targeted advertising (unless you add an ad SDK — update this policy accordingly).
- Tracking: we do not track users across apps and websites for advertising purposes (unless you add a tracking SDK — update this policy accordingly).

Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. We will post the updated policy with a new effective date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
